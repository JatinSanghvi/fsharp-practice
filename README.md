# Parting Notes

This should be my first and last F# project. I am done with function
programming. I had developed a strong liking for functional
languages after trying my hand on SML, Racket, and Scala on
Coursera.com. Now, it seems that the problems were engineered only to
ensure that the students can understand functional programming concepts,
and not to help them solve real world problems through funtional
programming.

Why do also functional languages try to be as terse as possible? Code
readability should be a primary criteria while framing a new language.
And why do we have ten different ways to solve the same problem? And on
top of that, we have language sugars which can exponentially increase
the number of different possible solutions for the same problem.

The F# primitives like higher order functions are readily available in
C#, they are more readable and they play well with other C# language
features. I think the only big feature that C# misses our is the native
support for immutability. If it can acheive it, I do not see any point
worth spending on the F# language.
