# Parting Notes

This should be my first and last F# project. I am done with function
programming. I had developed a strong liking for functional
languages after trying my hands on SML, Racket, and Scala on
Coursera.com. Now, it seems that the Coursera problems were engineered
only to ensure that the students can understand functional programming
concepts, and not to help them solve real world problems through
funtional programming.

I do not understand why the functional languages aim to be as terse as
possible? Terseness has nothing to do with functional programming. Code
readability should be the foremost criteria for framing a language that
should handle real world scenarios. And why do functional languages
provide several different syntaxes to solve the same problem? And on top
of that, we have syntactic sugars. Overall, the language creators ensure
that every developer will arrive with a different solution to the same
problem.

The F# primitives like higher order functions are readily available in
C#, they are more readable and they play well with other C# language
features. I think the only big feature that C# misses out is the native
support for immutability. If it can acheive it, I do not see any point
worth spending on the F# language.
